# European-Constitution
A collection of different drafts for the future European (Federal) Constitution.

Following the example of [BundesGit](https://twitter.com/bundesgit) (a copy of the German Federal Law on GitHub) and the [District of Columbiaâ€™s legal code](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/how-i-changed-the-law-with-a-github-pull-request/) (the real  authoritative digital source for DC laws on GitHub) as well as a blog post by Abe Voelker called [GitLaw](https://blog.abevoelker.com/gitlaw-github-for-laws-and-legal-documents-a-tourniquet-for-american-liberty/) this repository tries to collect (and perhaps merge, amend and comment) drafts of the future European (Federal) Constitution.
